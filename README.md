This is an unofficial Maya control rig for Terry's first person view (citizen.fbx) in s&box.

This rig is large in scale, so increase your camera clipping plane to something substantial. In the outliner, select your persp camera (or whatever camera you're using) and increase the Far Clip Plane to something like 50000.

Because of the scale, you also need to adjust joint size. Adjusting Display > Animation > Joint Size will also allow you to see the joints of the bones (if you need to modify it for some reason).

This is an active work in progress. If there are any issues or complaints, please let me know.
